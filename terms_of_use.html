                    following conditions:</p>

                <p>You have valid agreements with your customers that require compliance with the applicable terms of
                    this Agreement, including any conditions or restrictions related to the use or access of the
                    App.</p>
                <p>Your customers' access and use of the App are solely for supporting their use of your own products
                    and services unrelated to the App.</p>
                <p>Your customers do not receive any administrator, configuration, or similar access to the App.</p>

                    Documentation, and solely for the benefit of you or your Affiliates.</p>

                <h1>7. Access Credentials</h1>
                <p>If the App requires Access Credentials, you must ensure that all Authorized Users keep their Access
                    Credentials strictly confidential and do not share them with unauthorized individuals. User IDs are
                    granted to specific individuals and cannot be shared. Neither you nor Authorized Users may convey,

                    organization.</p>
                <p>You accept responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality and proper use of the Access
                    Credentials provided to your Authorized Users for accessing and using the App. You agree to notify
                    Vendor immediately if you become aware of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Access
                    Credentials.</p>

                <h1>8. Evaluation License</h1>
                <p>The App may be provided for a free evaluation period to assess its features and performance. The
                    evaluation license is granted for evaluation purposes only and for a limited time.</p>
                <p>Evaluation terms and conditions, including any extensions, are handled by Atlassian. Please refer to
                    the "Pricing" section of the App Details Page for more details.</p>

                <h1>9. Third-Party Software and Services</h1>
                <p>The App may connect, interoperate, work with, and/or utilize Third-Party Services.</p>
                <p>You acknowledge and understand that:</p>

                <p>Your use of any Third-Party Service and associated information will be governed by the applicable
                    license agreements or terms of services with the respective third party. You must comply with those
                    terms. Vendor is not responsible for the performance and reliability of any Third-Party Services and
                    disclaims any liability related to your use of such services.</p>
                <p>Vendor does not investigate or review any Third-Party Services and does not endorse or disapprove of
                    them.</p>

                <h1>10. Maintenance (Updates and Support)</h1>
                <p>The purchase price of Server Apps includes maintenance, including version updates and support.</p>
                <p>You are eligible for maintenance of Cloud Apps as long as your subscription is active.</p>

                <p>The pricing details and terms of maintenance renewal are specified in the "Pricing" section of the
                    App Details Page.</p>

                <p>Vendor may, at its sole discretion and on its own terms, provide maintenance for free Apps or Apps
                    provisioned via a beta license.</p>


                <p>Support for the App includes online documentation and email support. Support is available in English,
                    but Vendor may offer support in other languages or through other communication channels at its
                    discretion.</p>

                <p>Vendor will make updates or upgrades available for the App as and when they become available.</p>

                <p>Support and maintenance do not include custom software development or implementation of custom
                    features for the App, assistance with the Host Application or any other third-party services or
                    products, or their updating, maintenance, or support.</p>

                <h1>11. Data Collection and Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Any information and data collected by Vendor from you or your device will be subject to Vendor's
                    Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>By entering into this Agreement, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, as it exists at any
                    relevant time.</p>

                <h1>12. Confidentiality</h1>
                <p>Vendor does not require you to provide any confidential or non-public information.</p>
                <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical,
                    and financial information disclosed by one party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving
                    Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information").
                    The Receiving Party agrees to hold such Confidential Information in confidence and not to use or
                    disclose it except as permitted by this Agreement. The Receiving Party's obligations regarding
                    Confidential Information do not apply to information that:</p>

                <p>Was already in the Receiving Party's possession or known to it prior to the disclosure.</p>
                <p>Became public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.</p>
                <p>Was rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any
                    confidentiality obligation.</p>
                <p>Was independently developed by the Receiving Party's employees who had no access to the Confidential
                    Information.</p>
                <p>Vendor's intellectual property and technology will be considered Confidential Information without any
                    specific marking or designation.</p>

                <p>The Receiving Party shall not use or disclose any Confidential Information except as authorized
                    herein or as required by law.</p>

                <h1>13. Disclaimers of Warranties</h1>
                <p>The App is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind, express or implied.</p>
                <p>All express or implied conditions, representations, and warranties, including any implied warranty of
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, are disclaimed to the extent
                    permitted by law. You assume responsibility for selecting the App to achieve your intended results
                    and for the installation, use, and results obtained from the App or the information made available
                    through the App. Vendor makes no warranty that the App will be error-free or free from
                    interruptions, failures, or that it will meet your requirements.</p>

                <h1>14. Limitation of Liability</h1>
                <p>Neither party shall be liable for any loss resulting from causes beyond its direct control, including
                    but not limited to electronic or mechanical equipment failures, communication line failures,
                    Internet or telephone issues, unauthorized access, theft, errors, or force majeure events.</p>
                <p>To the extent not prohibited by law, neither party shall be liable for any lost revenue, profit, or
                    data, or for special, indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, regardless of the
                    theory of liability, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the App, even if a
                    party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitation of liability
                    applies to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. The aggregate
                    liability of either party to the other shall not exceed the amount actually paid by you to the
                    Reseller for the App in the 6 months immediately preceding the claim. Notwithstanding anything else
                    in this Agreement, our aggregate liability to you for free Apps shall be limited to US$20. No
                    aggregate liability applies to Apps provisioned via a beta license. This limitation of liability
                    shall not apply to either party's express indemnification obligations in this Agreement or to your
                    breach of Section 4 (License Restrictions). The parties agree that the limitations specified in this
                    section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement fails of its
                    essential purpose.</p>

                <p>Tothe maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with
                    respect to free Apps, including any maintenance, warranty, and indemnity obligations.</p>

                <h1>15. Indemnification</h1>
                <p>Indemnification by You: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Vendor, its Affiliates, officers,
                    directors, employees, agents, and representatives from any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
                    damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and attorney's fees arising from or related to your use
                    of the App and/or your violation of this Agreement or any third party's rights.</p>
                <p>Indemnification by Vendor: Vendor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless you, your
                    Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives from any and all claims,
                    liabilities, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and attorney's fees arising from
                    or related to any threatened or actual claim for infringement, breach, or misappropriation of any
                    intellectual property or proprietary right based on the use of the App by you or your
                    Affiliates.</p>

                <h1>16. Modifications</h1>
                <p>Vendor reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or revise this Agreement, update or
                    modify the Documentation, make changes, update or discontinue the App or any of its features or
                    functionalities, and terminate or restrict access to the App.</p>
                <p>If a revision of the Agreement significantly reduces your rights, we will make reasonable efforts to
                    notify you through email, postings on Vendor's website, or within the App itself. You may be
                    required to accept the updated Agreement.</p>

                <p>If you do not agree to the updated Agreement after it becomes effective, you must discontinue your
                    use of the App.</p>

                <p>Your continued use of the App after a change or update has been made will constitute your acceptance
                    of the amended Agreement.</p>

                <h1>17. Term and Termination</h1>
                <p>This Agreement begins upon your first installation, download, subscription, or use of the App,
                    regardless of whether it is provided for evaluation, as a fully licensed version, a beta licensed
                    version, or in any other form.</p>
                <p>Unless terminated earlier as provided herein or due to the expiration of the evaluation period, this
                    Agreement is effective for the term specified in the "Pricing" section of the App Details Page.</p>

                <p>You may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>

                <p>Vendor may suspend or terminate this Agreement with you or suspend or terminate your use of the App
                    at any time without liability if:</p>

                <p>You violate any term of this Agreement.</p>
                <p>You infringe proprietary rights, privacy rights, or intellectual property rights of any person,
                    business, or organization.</p>
                <p>Your actions related to the use of the App are illegal, cause liability, harm, abuse, or disruption
                    to you, other users, Vendor, or any third parties, or to the App.</p>
                <p>We have not received the corresponding payment for the App from the Reseller.</p>
                <p>Termination is required by law.</p>
                <p>Vendor ceases to offer or discontinues the App.</p>
                <p>We may terminate your right to use free Apps or Apps provisioned via a beta license at any time and
                    for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.</p>

                <p>Your license will end upon any termination of this Agreement, even if it is identified as "perpetual"
                    or if no expiration date is specified when you ordered the App.</p>

                <p>Upon termination, all license grants will end, and you must destroy and permanently erase all copies
                    of the App and Vendor's Confidential Information and cease all use.</p>

                <p>Regardless of the cause of termination, you will not receive any credits or refunds for any license
                    or maintenance fees paid in advance, unless otherwise provided by the Atlassian Marketplace T&C. You
                    acknowledge that Resellers are responsible for refunds, and you will not request any refunds from
                    Vendor.</p>

                <p>Survival: The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement:
                    Sections 2 (Ownership), 4 (License Restrictions), 5 (Payment, Subscriptions, Renewals, Refunds,
                    Delivery), 9 (Third-Party Software and Services), 12 (Confidentiality), 13 (Disclaimers of
                    Warranties), 14 (Limitation of Liability), 17 (Term and Termination), 18 (Jurisdiction), and 19
                    (Miscellaneous).</p>

                <h1>18. Jurisdiction</h1>
                <p>Choice of Law: This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Armenia, without regard to
                    its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                    Sale of Goods does not apply.</p>
                <p>Location for Resolving Disputes: Any disputes or claims related to this Agreement will be resolved by
                    state courts located in the Republic of Armenia. By entering into this Agreement, you waive any
                    claims against Vendor and/or its Affiliates based on the laws of other jurisdictions, including your
                    own. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts in the Republic of
                    Armenia for resolving any disputes or claims with us. This provision does not limit Vendor's right
                    to take legal action in any other court of competent jurisdiction. The submission to the
                    jurisdiction of a specific court does not preclude proceedings in other jurisdictions, whether
                    concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.</p>

                <h1>19. Miscellaneous</h1>
                <p>Consent to Receive Communications in Electronic Form: By entering into this Agreement, you consent to
                    receive communications from us in electronic form via the email address you provided. You agree that
                    this Agreement, along with all other agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications
                    provided to you electronically, satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in
                    writing.</p>
                <p>Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the Agreement will
                    remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless its omission would frustrate the intent of the
                    parties, in which case the Agreement will terminate immediately.</p>

                <p>Export/Import Laws: You are responsible for complying with any applicable export or import rules,
                    regulations, and restrictions related to the purchase or use of the App.</p>

                <p>Assignment: You may not assign or transfer this Agreement. Vendor may freely assign, transfer, and
                    delegate its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Vendor's Affiliates, contractors, and
                    service providers may exercise all rights of Vendor under this Agreement.</p>

                <p>Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Vendor regarding
                    its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,
                    proposals, representations, and warranties. This Agreement prevails over any conflicting or
                    additional terms in any quote, order, acknowledgment, letter, or other communication between the
                    parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.</p>
